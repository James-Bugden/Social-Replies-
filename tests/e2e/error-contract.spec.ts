/**
 * The error contract, over the wire, against a production build.
 *
 * Every one of these passed as a unit test while the shipped app answered 500.
 * `instanceof AppError` was false in the production bundle, because Next hands a
 * server component and a route handler separate copies of the module, and the
 * store was constructed by one while the route caught from the other. Nothing
 * that imports the modules directly can see that: there is only ever one copy in
 * a test runner.
 *
 * So these run through HTTP, against `next build` output, which is the only place
 * the bug existed.
 *
 * They also load a page first, and that detail is the whole test. The chunk split
 * only bites when the store is *constructed* by the server-component chunk and the
 * error is *caught* by the route-handler chunk. An API call on its own builds the
 * store inside the route chunk, so both halves agree and the bug hides. Two
 * separate attempts to confirm this defect concluded it did not reproduce, for
 * exactly that reason; the first version of this file passed with the bug
 * deliberately reintroduced.
 *
 * One trap when checking that by hand: `reuseExistingServer` is on outside CI,
 * so a server left running from an earlier build is silently reused and the
 * rebuild never happens. Two runs reported five passes against a stale binary
 * before that was noticed. Kill anything on 3100 before trusting a green run.
 */

/**
 * Forces the server-component chunk to build the store before any route touches it.
 *
 * Without this line every assertion below passes whether the bug is present or not.
