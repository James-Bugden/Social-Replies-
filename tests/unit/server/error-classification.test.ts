/**
 * How a thrown error becomes a status code.
 *
 * This had no tests, and the gap cost a real defect: every deliberate 409, 401
 * and 429 raised by the store was returned as a 500 reading "Something went
 * wrong", so a version conflict looked like a crash and optimistic concurrency
 * was silently dead across the whole app.
 *
 * It took two mistakes at once. `instanceof AppError` was false in the production
 * build, because Next hands a server component and a route handler separate copies
 * of the module and the store was constructed by one while the route caught from
 * the other. That alone would have been survivable. But the fall-through read any
 * string `code` as a SQLSTATE, and an AppError carries a `code` too, so
 * `version_conflict` was mapped as a database state, matched nothing, and
 * defaulted to `internal_error`. The first bug produced the wrong branch; the
 * second one made it silent.
 *
 * Both are closed here, and each is tested separately so that fixing one and
 * regressing the other cannot pass.
