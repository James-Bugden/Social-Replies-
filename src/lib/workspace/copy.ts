/**
 * Every user-facing string in the workspace, in one place (D12).
 *
 * Two reasons this is a module rather than text scattered through components.
 * First, D12 specifies exact copy and it should be possible to diff the app
 * against the specification. Second, and more importantly, the rule that "all
 * success and error copy is tied to actual state" is only checkable if the states
 * and their strings sit side by side: it is obvious here that there is no string
 * for "Draft saved" that a component could reach for while text merely sits in
 * browser memory.
 *
 * The interface is English in v1. Personal replies follow the owner's own voice,
 * which is a different register and lives in the generation prompts, not here.
