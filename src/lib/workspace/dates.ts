 * Turning a recorded instant into the day the owner would call it.

 * The counter already does this correctly, in SQL: it converts `posted_at` into
 * the configured timezone before taking a date. Everything that *displayed* a
 * date was slicing the UTC string instead, so a reply posted at 00:30 Taipei was
 * counted as today and shown as yesterday. That is the exact window the counter
 * exists to get right, and disagreeing with itself is worse than either answer.
 *
 * A date-only value is returned untouched. It has no time, so converting it
 * would invent one, and C04 is explicit that unknown precision stays unknown.
