/**
 * Turns model output into text a social platform shows exactly as written.
 *
 * LinkedIn, Threads and X do not render markdown. A model told to write "plain
 * text ready to post" still reaches for **bold** and "* " bullets often enough to
 * matter, and before this nothing caught it: the asterisks went into the editor,
 * onto the clipboard and into a live post.
 *
 * Scope is deliberate. This runs on what a model wrote, before the owner sees it,
 * and never on anything the owner typed, which is saved byte for byte (SAVE-01).
 * Owner text with a trailing space or a literal asterisk stays exactly as typed.
 *
 * What survives is the formatting every platform actually shows: line breaks,
 * blank lines between paragraphs, bullet and numbered lists, emoji. Link targets
 * are dropped and their text kept, because a URL in a reply is the application's
 * job (C06), and a markdown link is just a URL the model tried to smuggle past it.
 *
 * Every rule is anchored so ordinary text is left alone: arithmetic ("5 * 3"), a
 * lone footnote asterisk, snake_case names and @handles all pass through
 * unchanged. The function is idempotent, so cleaning twice changes nothing.
