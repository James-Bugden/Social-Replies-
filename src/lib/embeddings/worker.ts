/**
 * The embedding outbox worker (C05, C09).
 *
 * The contract it exists to keep is that recording a reply never waits on a
 * model API. The save writes a lexical search row and a job in one transaction;
 * this worker turns jobs into vectors afterwards, and every way it can fail
 * leaves the reply exactly as findable as it was the moment it was saved.
 *
 * Three properties do the work:
 *
 *   * a **lease**, so two workers cannot spend two API calls on one job;
 *   * a **text hash guard**, so a job queued before a correction cannot write its
 *     stale vector over the corrected row. The guard is part of the UPDATE's
 *     WHERE clause rather than a read-then-write check, because a correction can
 *     land between the read and the write;
 *   * a **bounded attempt count**, after which the job is `dead` and stays
 *     retryable by an explicit operator action rather than looping forever.
 *
 * The worker is handed its runner, its embedder and its clock. It opens nothing
 * and schedules nothing, so a test can run it, advance time and run it again.
