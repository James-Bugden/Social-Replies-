 * The injection defence is architectural: the generator has no tools, no browsing
 * and no secrets, so there is nothing for a pasted instruction to command. What this
 * module checks is the one thing that *could* still go wrong, which is the model
 * writing something into the reply that should not leave the machine, or announcing
 * that it has been re-instructed.
 *
 * It is not a content filter. It does not touch text the owner wrote.
