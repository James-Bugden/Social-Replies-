/**
 * Grounding (issue #14, tests FACT-01, RES-02, AI-01).
 *
 * The rule this module enforces is narrow and worth stating plainly: a valid fact id
 * does not make a sentence true. A model can cite a real fact and still write a
 * number that is not in it, promote "contributed to" into "led", or attach the claim
 * to an employer the fact never mentions. So every referenced id is checked against
 * *this request's* eligible context, and then the claim itself is checked against the
 * text of the facts it cites.
 *
 * Every finding here is a hard failure. The orchestrator gets one shared repair
 * attempt; if the result is still unsafe, the ideas are withheld and the owner keeps
 * retrieval and the manual editor, which is a worse product but an honest one.
