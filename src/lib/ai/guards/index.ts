 * The validation layer (issue #14).

 * One pass, two outcomes. A *hard* failure means the ideas cannot be shown: an
 * unknown id, an unsupported personal claim, a leaked credential shape, a missing
 * Chinese review meaning, or three ideas that are not actually three ideas. A
 * *soft* finding is shown to the owner as a plain warning and changes nothing else.
 *
 * This layer has no retry loop of its own. #12 owns a single shared repair budget,
 * and a second loop here would silently double the cost of every bad response.
