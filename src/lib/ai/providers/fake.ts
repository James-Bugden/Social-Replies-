/**
 * The fake provider (C08, C07).
 *
 * It exists so that the whole application can be built, tested and demonstrated
 * without a paid key, and so that browser journeys are deterministic. It returns
 * schema-valid output that goes through exactly the same validation, guards and
 * resource resolution as a real response.
 *
 * It is labelled. Every reply it produces says it is an example, because a fake
 * that is indistinguishable from real output is how a demo becomes a false claim.
 *
 * It answers the question it was asked. Emitting the ideas payload for every task
 * meant a rewrite request was answered with a JSON blob, and the owner was offered
 * it as a revision of their reply; the English meaning of a Chinese draft was the
 * same blob, saved to the session as what their Chinese says. Each task therefore
 * has its own stand-in, in the shape that task declares.
