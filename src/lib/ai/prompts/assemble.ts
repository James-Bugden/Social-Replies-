/**
 * Assembles the request (C08, SEC-04).
 *
 * The only defence that actually works against instructions hidden inside a pasted
 * post is that there is nothing for them to command: the generator holds no tools,
 * no secrets and no authority. Delimiting is the second layer, not the first.
 *
 * What delimiting does buy is clarity about which bytes are data. Every untrusted
 * block is fenced with a nonce that the pasted text cannot predict, so a post
 * containing a literal closing fence cannot end its own block early.
