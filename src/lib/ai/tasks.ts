/**
 * The two single-answer tasks: rewriting the owner's own draft (D08) and reading a
 * Chinese draft back in English (D09).
 *
 * Both used to be "send some text and trust whatever comes back". That made two
 * things possible at once. A provider answering a different question reached the
 * owner as a proposal, and a proposal reached the owner without passing any of the
 * checks a generated idea has to pass. Declaring the shape of each answer closes
 * the first; putting a rewrite through `runGuards` closes the second.
 *
 * The instructions live here rather than in the routes because the fake provider
 * has to be able to tell which question it was asked, and a shared module is the
 * only version of that which cannot drift.
