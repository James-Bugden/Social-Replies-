/**
 * The two lexical signals, each retrieved independently (C05).
 *
 * They are separate because they fail in opposite directions. English full-text
 * search stems and drops stopwords, which is exactly right for a sentence-length
 * English query and completely useless for Traditional Chinese: a run of Han
 * characters with no spaces becomes a single token, so searching for 面試 never
 * matches 面試準備技巧. Trigram matching has no idea what a word is, which is why
 * it handles Chinese and two-letter keywords, and why on its own it happily
 * ranks a document that shares a few characters with the query.
 *
 * Fusing the two ranks (see `fusion.ts`) is what makes either one safe to use.
 *
 * Neither builder writes SQL. Both call a Postgres function defined in
 * `supabase/migrations/20260922000700_retrieval_candidates.sql`, because PostgREST
 * has no raw-SQL channel and a query assembled here could be verified locally but
 * never run in production. One definition, called from a SQL connection here and
 * through `rpc()` by an ordinary web request, means the query these tests exercise
 * is the query production runs.
 *
 * Every value travels as a bound parameter. Nothing the owner typed is ever
 * concatenated into a statement.
