 * another. `ts_rank_cd` and `word_similarity` are different quantities on
 * different scales, so adding or averaging them would silently let whichever one
 * happens to produce larger numbers decide the order. RRF throws the scores away
 * and keeps only the positions, which is the only honest thing to do with them.
 *
 * The resulting number is a fusion score. It is not a probability, a similarity
 * and above all not a confidence percentage: nothing in this file produces a
 * value fit to render as "87% match", and nothing downstream should invent one.
