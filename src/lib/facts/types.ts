 * same type rather than each inventing a slightly different one, which is how
 * a gate quietly stops matching what the database actually enforces.
 *
 * `valid_from` and `valid_to` are date-only strings (`YYYY-MM-DD`), matching
 * the SQL `date` column: they carry no time zone of their own, so a gate that
 * compares them against a caller's local clock time would be answering a
 * question nobody asked.
