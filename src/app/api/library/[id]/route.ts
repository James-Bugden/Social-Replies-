/**
 * PATCH /api/library/:id (D05, D11, D14, C07).
 *
 * Two distinct actions share a route because they share a shape: both act on one
 * already-recorded reply and both are things the owner does to *this app's own
 * record* of what happened, never to the reply sitting on the social platform.
 *
 * A correction appends a private revision rather than rewriting history silently:
 * `store.correctReply` takes the revision the form was shown and rejects a stale
 * one, so a second correction made from another tab cannot be overwritten without
 * the owner seeing that it happened. A withdrawal only flips this app's own flag;
 * `setReplyWithdrawn` never calls out to LinkedIn, X or Threads.
 *
 * `ownerRoute`'s wrapper does not thread Next's dynamic-segment params through to
 * the handler, so the id is read directly off the request's own path rather than
 * from a second argument that never arrives here.
