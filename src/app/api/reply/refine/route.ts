/**
 * POST /api/reply/refine (D08).
 *
 * This returns a proposal and nothing else. It does not update the session, and
 * the editor is not touched until the owner presses Apply rewrite, because a
 * rewrite that lands while they are mid-sentence destroys work they cannot recover.
 *
 * `base_editor_version` travels back with the proposal so the client can tell
 * whether it is still about the text on screen.
 *
 * A proposal sits one click from the editor, so it carries the authority of a
 * generated idea and is held to the same checks. This route used to return the
 * provider's raw text, which meant a rewrite could carry a link, a figure nobody
 * supplied, or a claim about the owner's career that no approved fact supports, and
 * one press of Apply rewrite would copy it in byte for byte. A rewrite that fails
 * the checks is not offered at all: the owner's own reply is already on screen and
 * is the safe thing to keep.
