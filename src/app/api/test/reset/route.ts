/**
 * Empties the browser-journey test double.
 *
 * The double is a singleton for a good reason: a journey spans several requests
 * and has to see its own writes. The cost is that it also spans several *tests*,
 * so one that creates a fact or disables a resource silently changes the world the
 * next one runs in. That is invisible when a file is run alone and appears as an
 * unrelated failure when the whole suite runs, which is the worst way for it to
 * show up.
 *
 * So each journey resets first, and order stops mattering.
 *
 * Outside `SR_TEST_MODE=e2e` this route does not exist: it answers 404, exactly as
 * an unrouted path would, rather than announcing that there is something here to
 * find.
