-- only thing any client can learn is a boolean.

-- `revoke ... from public` is NOT enough on a hosted Supabase project: its default
-- privileges grant EXECUTE on every new function in `public` directly to `anon` and
-- `authenticated`, and a direct grant survives a revoke from PUBLIC. The hosted
-- security advisor caught this on a schema whose local tests were already green,
-- so anon is revoked by name here and in every other function this app defines.

-- Bootstrapping is a private operation performed against the provisioned project:
--   insert into private.app_owner (user_id) values ('<the owner auth user id>');
-- No owner identifier belongs in this repository (SECURITY.md).
